## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

[Pokédex For All 1025 Pokémon](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rzgiza/pokdex-for-all-1025-pokemon-w-text-description)

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
>   - The goal of our project is to explore how Pokémon stats and design characteristics have evolved across generations, and whether there is a connection between the way a Pokémon’s name sounds and its perceived power or evolutionary status. We’re especially interested in identifying naming patterns—do stronger or more evolved Pokémon tend to have “heavier” sounding names? And how has the stat distribution shifted from Generation 1 to Generation 10?  
>   
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.
>   - The final output will be an interactive, Pokédex-style web app that lets users explore these patterns through intuitive visualizations. Our target audience includes Pokémon fans, data visualization learners, and anyone curious about how sound symbolism and design trends intersect in long-running franchises like Pokémon.

> - What others have already done with the data?  
>   - Our project builds on a study by Shigeto Kawahara (2018), which found that voiced sounds in Japanese Pokémon names tend to signal strength and size. While this linguistic idea has been academically discussed, it hasn’t been widely visualized or combined with broader stat data across all generations. On the data side, we’ve seen YouTube creators use animation to explore Pokémon stats and size comparisons, but these are often informal and not interactive. We aim to take that style of presentation and add analytical depth by connecting phonology to game stats.  
>
> - Why is your approach original?  
>   - What makes our project original is its integration of linguistic features from Japanese name data with visualizations of stat and design trends across generations. To our knowledge, no existing visualization tool explores this specific intersection.  
>
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).

> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.  
>   - This dataset has not been previously explored in another course context.
